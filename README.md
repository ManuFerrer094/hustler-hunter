Data is stored in sessionStorage with these keys:
- `hustler-hunter-gurus`: Array of guru objects
- `hustler-hunter-reports`: Array of report objects
- `hustler-hunter-settings`: Application settings including mock data flag

## üîÆ Future MongoDB Integration

The application is designed to easily transition to MongoDB:

### Planned Schema

```javascript
// Guru Collection
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  name: String,
  niche: String,
  rating: Number,
  bio: String,
  imageUrl: String,
  evidence: [EvidenceSchema],
  reports: [ReportSchema],
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}

// Report Collection
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  guruId: ObjectId,
  title: String,
  description: String,
  category: String,
  evidence: String,
  reporterName: String,
  createdAt: Date
}
```

### Migration Steps
1. Set up MongoDB Atlas cluster
